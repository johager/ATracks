# ATracks

This is my capstone project for the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp.

The app tracks a user's activity using GPS locations and HealthKit steps.

Data is persisted locally using CoreData and in the cloud using CloudKit. Information is synched between all devices with the same Apple ID.

The app is designed to work on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
