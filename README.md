# ATracks

This is my capstone project for the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp.

The app tracks a user's activity and maps the location using GPS coordinates from CoreLocation and tracks a user's steps using HealthKit to access the Apple Health app.

Data is persisted locally using CoreData and in the cloud using CloudKit via an NSPersistentCloudKitContainer. Information is synched between all devices with the same Apple ID.

The app is designed to work on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
