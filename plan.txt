This will be an iOS and macOS app for users to:

1) Track their workout/hiking activity using location and step data.

2) Provide route guidance based on waypoints.

The iOS app is mainly to track the activity using the GPS and the macOS app is mainly to view existing tracks and create new routes by taking advantage of the larger screen size.

It will be created using Swift, SwiftUI, HealthKit, and Firebase.

=== MVP ===

The MVP will operate on only iOS devices and will only provide location data.
